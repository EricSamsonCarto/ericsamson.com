# Portfolio Website - Next Steps

## Completed âœ“
- Header component with navigation and active page indicators
- PageLayout with proper margins (max-w-3xl, px-4 mobile, px-14 desktop)
- ContentLayout with same margins as PageLayout
- Raleway font with heavier weight (450)
- Public folder structure for images
- Project structure planning

## Next Steps

### 1. Content Collections Setup
- [x] Create `src/content/config.ts` with Zod schemas for all collections
  - Define schema for projects (title, date, description, thumbnail, etc.)
  - Define schema for tech writing
  - Define schema for books writing
  - Define schema for life writing
- [ ] Create sample content files to test with
  - 4-5 sample projects in `src/content/projects/`
  - 4-5 sample tech posts in `src/content/tech/`
  - 4-5 sample books posts in `src/content/books/`
  - 4-5 sample life posts in `src/content/life/`

### 2. Core Components (Build in this order)

#### ContentCard.astro
- Display individual content preview card
- Props: title, excerpt, date, slug, thumbnail, collection type
- Responsive design (different sizing for mobile/desktop)
- Hover effects

#### ContentPreviewGrid.astro
- Reusable grid component
- Props: collection items, section title, "view more" link, display count
- Shows last 4 items on desktop, 3 on mobile

#### Footer.astro
- Copyright with name
- Social media links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.)
- Same max-w-3xl and padding as other layouts

### 3. TypeScript Utility Files
Create separate .ts files for logic (per Astro guidelines):

- [ ] `src/utils/content-helpers.ts`
  - Function to get last N items from collection
  - Function to sort by date
  - Function to merge multiple collections chronologically

- [ ] `src/utils/date-helpers.ts`
  - Format date for display
  - Sort by date functions

### 4. Pages Implementation

- [ ] `writing/books/index.astro` - All books posts
- [ ] `writing/life/index.astro` - All life posts

- [ ] `writing/books/[slug].astro` - Individual book post
- [ ] `writing/life/[slug].astro` - Individual life post

### 5. Styling & Polish
- [ ] Ensure consistent spacing between sections
- [ ] Add smooth transitions and hover effects
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness thoroughly
- [ ] Add loading states if needed
- [ ] Optimize images

### 6. Testing & Content
- [ ] Test all navigation flows

- [ ] Test with different content lengths
- [ ] Cross-browser testing

## Design Notes
- Header margin: max-w-3xl with px-14 on desktop, px-4 on mobile
- All content uses same max-width to align with header
- Font: Raleway weight 500 for body
- Active page indicator: 60% width, centered, 1px underline
- Hover color: gray-400 for both text and underline
