Like everyone else, I love Malcolm Gladwell. I read “Outliers” last year and have decided to go through the rest of his bibliography.

I enjoyed this one, but not as much as I enjoyed “Outliers”. The basic premise is that for every behavior, idea, or product, there is a statistical breaking point that allows that thing, whatever it may be, to explode into an epidemic. There are different people in our society responsible for pushing this tipping point over: connectors, mavens, and salesman. If you can engage these three groups of people, your idea or product could become a bug.

He brings up examples like certain fashion trends gaining favor, the crime rate in New York dropping after 1990, and Blues Clues’ popularity. But my biggest take away was the optimal size for groups of people: 150. After that number, a group can begin to fall apart or no longer be as effective in their combined goals. Gladwell claims, that in order to maintain a strong cohesive community, a group should maintain no greater than 150 people, since humans have difficulty maintaining social relationships when their lives are filled with anymore than 150 other individuals. He gives examples from businesses, colleges, and other organizations. 

This makes sense based on my experiences; I’ve worked in larger corporations where I am just a small spoke in a larger wheel. I did not feel effective day to day. Whenever I am with a smaller group, I know who to talk to regarding “x”, who to call to get me “y”, and who to delegate “z” to.
