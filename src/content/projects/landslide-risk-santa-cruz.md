It's official: I am now a master. I completed my master's thesis project earlier this month. I did my thesis on an area of the country that is near and dear to my heart: Santa Cruz. I attempted to develop a Landslide Risk Assesment model that would be able to identify areas of extreme risk for Landslides throughout this mountaineous area. The results were not highly correlated with histroically recorded landslides for the area. Which was disapointing, but thats science. Here are some of the cartography I did for my thesis:
