I finished up my Cartography and Data Visualization class for my masters program last weekend. Overall, it's been a great experience practicing my cartography while receiving constructive feedback from my classmates and professors. The course challenged me to think creatively while using data and design styles that I have not previously attempted to use. Below you can find some of the favorite graphics I created during the course:

### Dot Density
